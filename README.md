## My computer experience till now:

I got my first computer when I was in 10th standard. I mostly used my pc for basic learning and entertainment purposes at that time. After 2 years I got access to the internet and it has changed how I was using the computer.

One day, I accidentally downloaded a game on pc but when I tried to play it, it was not running properly and after some research, I came to know that my pc hardware was not capable of running that game. During the time I was figuring out the solution, I got so interested in computer hardware that I started to spend most of my time learning about new computer hardware. and I realized that how many different options are available to us in terms of computer hardware. After that, I have built  2 custom pc for myself and helped lots of people to build theirs.


My sister is also a programmer and I have always been fascinated by my sister's work. So, I decided to do my bachelor's in Information and Technology. C was the first programming language that I learned before I went to college. Afterward, I learned C++, JAVA, and SQL. I have been using the internet to my advantage for learning new programming languages, tools, and software. I chose to make a game for my final project in my bachelor. I learned Unity3D from scratch from tutorials on their official website as well as different software like blender, gimp to help me with the development of the game. In last semester,  I  worked on data science project with Hadoop cluster of raspberry pies and learned so many new things.


## How am I going to use my knowledge of this class in future:

The Web development is growing so rapidly right now especially after the introduction of different frameworks which has increased development speed and efficiency by manyfold. 


I am so excited for this class to learn fundamentals for the web development. The fact that you can give the real shape to your idea by building the web application from the scratch within a small period of time is truly amazing. I looking forward to building some web applications which will help to solve some real-life problems. As we are learning source control also in this class, it will be helpful for all the projects that I will do in future.
