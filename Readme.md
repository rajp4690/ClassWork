## About Me

My name is Raj Patel and I am 22 years old. I have completed my bachelor degree in Information Technology from India. My hobbies are photography, drawing, dancing, and gaming. I like to try out and learn new things even though sometimes its challenging.

**_My computer experience till now:_**

I got my first computer when I was in 10th standard. I mostly used my pc for basic learning and entertainment purposes at that time. After 2 years I got access to the internet and it has changed how I was using the computer.

One day, I accidentally downloaded a game on pc but when I tried to play it, it was not running properly and after some research, I came to know that my pc hardware was not capable of running that game. During the time I was figuring out the solution, I got so interested in computer hardware that I started to spend most of my time learning about new computer hardware and I realized that how many different options are available to us in terms of computer hardware. After that, I have built 2 custom pc for myself and helped lots of people to build theirs.

My sister is also a programmer and I have always been fascinated by my sister's work. So, I decided to do my bachelor's in Information and Technology. C was the first programming language that I learned before I went to college. Afterward, I learned C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have been using the internet to my advantage for learning new programming languages, tools, and software. I chose to make a game for my final project in my bachelor. I learned Unity3D from scratch from tutorials on their official website as well as different software like blender, gimp etc. to help me with the development of the game. I have taken Algorithms, Operating System, Data Warehousing and Data Mining, Programming and Data Structures, Data Compression, Web Technology and Programming, Computer Network, Foundation of Data Science, Computer System etc. classes. I have worked on data science project with Hadoop cluster of raspberry pies in last semester using Python, R, Spark for distributed computing and learned so many new things. I usually practice data structures and algorithms problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) and [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com).

**_How am I going to use my knowledge of this class in future:_**

The Web development is growing so rapidly right now especially after the introduction of different frameworks like Angular, Node etc. which has increased development speed and efficiency by manyfold. 

I am so excited for this class to learn fundamentals for the web development. The fact that you can give the real shape to your idea by building the web application from the scratch within a small period of time is truly amazing. I am looking forward to building some web applications which will help to solve some real-life problems. All of these skills and knowledge will also improve my resume and will help me to land a job. As we are also learning source control in this class, it will be helpful to organize and maintain code for all the projects that I will do in the future.
